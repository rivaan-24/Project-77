        Visual Studio Code is Javascript IDE platform that people can use around the globe. You can download Visual Studio Code on Windows and Mac. The Visual Studio Code platform that I am using is "Visual Studio Code 2019"

        Console Screens are good because, the coder can see an alternative way to test their code. They can note down anything they want to keep. In order to open the console screen, you need to inspect the screen and then, you can open "Console" tab on the top.

    <script>
        var first_name = "Rivaan";
        var last_name = "Shah";

        first_name.concat(last_name);
        console.log(first_name.concat(last_name))

        var a = 5;
        var b = 10;

        var add = a + b;
        console.log(add);
        var multiply = a * b;
        console.log(multiply);
        var divide = b / a;
        console.log(divide);
        var subtract = b - a;
        console.log(subtract);
